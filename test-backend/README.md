# test-backend

## Disclaimer

- Due to limitations from the **jest** testing framework, test suites have to be inside the **/backend** folder.

- The **db-connection.test** file present in this folder is a copy of the file used for testing that resides in the **/backend/test_backend** folder. It is **not** used during testing.

## Instructions

- In the **/backend** folder run:
```
$ npm run test_backend
```
